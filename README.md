## üèÜ Wins
Successfully integrated TypeScript into a React project within a short turnaround from just learning React.

Successfully integrate an outside API into the project.

Gain a more in-depth understanding of Cypress fixtures and general testing.

## üöß Challenges
Navigating and coordinating with a team with both a short turnaround and over a long weekend. 

Integrating Cypress within TypeScript proved to be an unforseen obstacle. 

Organizing individual responsibilities and giving each team member a chance to learn the technology given the scope of the project (i.e., if one person handled a type file, that left the rest of the team lacking that writing experience).
